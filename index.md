### Deep Learning to Map Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations 
with Daniel E. Ho, _Nature Sustainability_ (Forthcoming, 2019)

We develop a convolutional neural network using high resolution satellite images that offers an effective, highly accurate, and lower cost approach to detecting CAFO locations.

### Quality Review of Mass Adjudication: A Randomized Natural Experiment at the Board of Veterans Appeals, 2003-16
with Daniel E. Ho, David Ames, and David Marcus, _Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization_ (Forthcoming, 2019)

Studying a natural experiment in which 5-10% of draft opinions by judges of the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA) were randomly selected for "quality review" by a team of full-time staff attorneys, we show that quality review had no appreciable effects on appeals or remands.  

### Due Process and Mass Adjudication: Crisis and Reform
with Daniel E. Ho, David Ames, and David Marcus, _Stanford Law Review 72_ (Forthcoming, 2019)

We ask whether management programs that agencies use systematically to audit and improve the quality of their judges' decision-making can uphold the promise of due process in mass adjudication.

### New Evidence on Information Disclosure through Restaurant Hygiene Grading
with Zoe C. Ashwood and Daniel E. Ho, _American Economic Journal: Policy_ (Forthcoming, 2019)

Expanding hospitalization data and collecting new data on mandatorily reported illnesses, we show that a previous finding that restaurant grading decreased foodborne illness in LA does not hold up under improvements to the original data and methodology.
