## About me

I am a Ph.D. student in political science at Stanford University specializing in statistical methods for the study of American politics. Previously, I analyzed administrative policies at the local, state, and federal level as a research fellow at Stanford Law School.

### Deep Learning to Map Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations 
with Daniel E. Ho, _Nature Sustainability_ (Forthcoming, 2019)

Enforcement of environmental law depends critically on permitting and monitoring intensive animal agricultural facilities, known in the U.S. as "Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations" (CAFOs).  The current legal landscape in the U.S. has made it difficult for government agencies, environmental groups, and the public to know where such facilities are located. We show that applying a deep convolutional neural network with high resolution satellite images offers an effective, highly accurate, and lower cost approach to detecting CAFO locations. In North Carolina, the algorithm is able to detect 589 additional poultry CAFOs, representing an increase of 15\% from the baseline detected through manual enumeration.  We show how the approach scales over geography and time, and can inform compliance and monitoring priorities. 

### Quality Review of Mass Adjudication: A Randomized Natural Experiment at the Board of Veterans Appeals, 2003-16
with Daniel E. Ho, David Ames, and David Marcus, _Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization_ (Forthcoming, 2019)

We study a unique natural experiment, during which 5-10% of draft opinions by judges of the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA) were randomly selected for "quality review" by a team of full-time staff attorneys.  The express goals of this performance program were to measure accuracy and reduce remands on appeal. We use rich internal administrative data on nearly 600,000 cases from 2002-2016 to conduct the first rigorous evaluation of this program.  With precise estimates, we show that quality review had no appreciable effects on appeals or remands.  Based on internal records, we demonstrate that this inefficacy is likely by design, as meeting the performance measure of "accuracy" conflicted with error correction.  

### New Evidence on Information Disclosure through Restaurant Hygiene Grading: Reply
with Zoe C. Ashwood and Daniel E. Ho, _American Economic Journal: Policy_ (Forthcoming, 2019)

The case of restaurant hygiene grading occupies a central role in information disclosure scholarship.  Comparing Los Angeles, which enacted grading in 1998, with California from 1995-99, Jin and Leslie (2003) found that grading reduced foodborne illness hospitalizations by 20 percent. Expanding hospitalization data and collecting new data on mandatorily reported illnesses, we show that this finding does not hold up under improvements to the original data and methodology. The largest salmonella outbreak in state history hit Southern California before Los Angeles implemented grading.  Placebo tests detect the same treatment effects for Southern California counties, none of which changed restaurant grading.
