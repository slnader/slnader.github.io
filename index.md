## About me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science with a minor in computational and mathematical engineering at Stanford University. I specialize in adapting methods from engineering disciplines to tackle measurement issues in political science. My research interests include developing robust methods for computing latent embeddings on large datasets (campaign finance, roll call votes, large corpora of text), measuring polarization and extremism in American elections, and applying machine learning methods for more effective regulation.
