### Deep Learning to Map Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations
with Daniel E. Ho, _Nature Sustainability_ (2019)

We develop a convolutional neural network using high resolution satellite images that offers an effective, highly accurate, and lower cost approach to detecting CAFO locations.

### Quality Review of Mass Adjudication: A Randomized Natural Experiment at the Board of Veterans Appeals, 2003-16
with Daniel E. Ho, David Ames, and David Marcus, _Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization_ (2019)

Studying a natural experiment in which 5-10% of draft opinions by judges of the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA) were randomly selected for "quality review" by a team of full-time staff attorneys, we show that quality review had no appreciable effects on appeals or remands.

### New Evidence on Information Disclosure through Restaurant Hygiene Grading
with Zoe C. Ashwood and Daniel E. Ho, _American Economic Journal: Policy_ (2019)

Expanding hospitalization data and collecting new data on mandatorily reported illnesses, we show that a previous finding that restaurant grading decreased foodborne illness in LA does not hold up under improvements to the original data and methodology.

### Due Process and Mass Adjudication: Crisis and Reform
with Daniel E. Ho, David Ames, and David Marcus, _Stanford Law Review 72_ (2020)

We ask whether management programs that agencies use systematically to audit and improve the quality of their judges' decision-making can uphold the promise of due process in mass adjudication.

### The Effectiveness of a Neighbor-to-Neighbor Get-Out-the-Vote Program: Evidence from the 2017 Virginia State Elections
with Daniel E. Ho, Alison Morantz, and Tom A. Rutter, _Journal of Experimental Political Science_ (2021)

We analyze the results of a neighbor-to-neighbor, grassroots get-out-the-vote (GOTV) drive in Virginia, in which unpaid volunteers were encouraged to contact at least three nearby registered voters who were likely co-partisans yet relatively unlikely to vote in the 2017 state election. We find that the volunteers in the original program design drove a statistically significant 2.3\% increase in turnout, which was concentrated in the first voter pair assigned to each volunteer.

### Feasible Policy Evaluation by Design: A Randomized Synthetic Stepped-Wedge Trial of Mandated Disclosure in King County
with Daniel E. Ho and Becky Elias, _Evaluation Review_ (2020)

Evidence-based policy is limited by the perception that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are expensive and infeasible. We demonstrate how a stepped-wedge (randomized roll-out) design that adapts synthetic control methods overcame substantial practical, administrative, political, and statistical constraints to evaluating King County’s new food safety rating system.

### Deep Learning with Satellite Imagery to Enhance Environmental Enforcement
with Daniel E. Ho and Larry Y. Liu, In _Data Science Applied to Sustainability Analysis_

The protection of air, water, and land depends critically on the role of government agencies that monitor and enforce environmental laws. We argue that the vast increase in the quantity and quality of satellite imagery, coupled with rapid advances in computer vision, often dubbed the "deep learning" revolution, has the potential to substantially enhance environmental monitoring and enforcement.

### How Did Absentee Voting Affect the 2020 U.S. Election?
with Jesse Yoder, Andrew Myers, Toby Nowacki, Daniel M. Thompson, Jennifer Wu, Chenoa Yorgason, Andrew B. Hall

The 2020 U.S. election saw high turnout, a huge increase in absentee voting, and brought unified national Democratic control—yet, contrary to much punditry, these facts do not imply that vote-by-mail increased turnout or had major partisan effects. Focusing on natural experiments in Texas and Indiana, we find that 65-year-olds turned out at nearly the same rate as 64-year-olds, despite voting absentee at higher rates since they didn’t have to provide an excuse to do so.

### Are Dead People Voting By Mail? Evidence From Washington State Administrative Records
with Jennifer Wu, Chenoa Yorgason, Hanna Folsz, Andrew Myers, Toby Nowacki, Daniel M. Thompson, Jesse Yoder, Andrew B. Hall

A commonly expressed concern about vote-by-mail in the United States is that mail-in ballots are sent to dead people, stolen by bad actors, and counted as fraudulent votes. To evaluate how often this occurs in practice, we study the state of Washington, which sends every registered voter a mail-in ballot. After exploring the robustness of our findings to weaker conditions for matching names, we conclude that it seems extraordinarily rare for dead people’s ballots to be counted as votes in Washington’s universal vote-by-mail system.
