## About me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science with a minor in computational and mathematical engineering at Stanford University. I specialize in adapting methods from engineering disciplines to tackle measurement issues in political science. My research interests include measuring polarization and extremism in American elections, and developing applications of machine learning methods for more effective regulation.
